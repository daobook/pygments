"This file is overridden by _templates/styles.html and just exists to "
"allow the Styles gallery to be reliably linked from the documentation "
"(since its location varies between `make html` and `make dirhtml`)."
msgstr ""
"这个文件被 _templates/styles.html 覆盖，"
"它的存在只是为了让样式库能够从文档中可靠地链接起来"
"（因为它的位置在 `make html` 和 `make dirhtml` 之间不同）。"
