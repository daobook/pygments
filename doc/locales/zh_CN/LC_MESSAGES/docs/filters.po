"Transforming a stream of tokens into another stream is called "
"\"filtering\" and is done by filters. The most common example of filters "
"transform each token by applying a simple rules such as highlighting the "
"token if it is a TODO or another special word, or converting keywords to "
"uppercase to enforce a style guide. More complex filters can transform "
"the stream of tokens, such as removing the line identation or merging "
"tokens together. It should be noted that pygments filters are entirely "
"unrelated to Python's `filter "
"<https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter>`_."
