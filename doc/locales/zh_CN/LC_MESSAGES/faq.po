"Pygments is a syntax highlighting engine written in Python. That means, "
"it will take source code (or other markup) in a supported language and "
"output a processed version (in different formats) containing syntax "

"The Pygments lexing machinery is quite powerful can be used to build "

"Also, error reporting is not the scope of Pygments. It focuses on "
